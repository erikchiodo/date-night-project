# date-night-project

## Description

Creating an app that finds a movie and restaurant in your area for the perfect date night :)

The goal of this project was to work with a team to create a real-world front-end application that youâ€™ll be able to showcase to potential employers. In our app we used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and leveraged two Google APIs (GeoCode & Google Maps). See Screenshots below for a visual walkthrough of our application.
